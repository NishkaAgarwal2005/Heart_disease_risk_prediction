# Heart_disease_risk_prediction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major global health concern, and early detection is crucial for effective prevention and management. This project leverages various machine learning models to predict CVDs, aiming to provide a robust and reliable AI-powered solution for healthcare professionals and patients.


Project Overview
This study explores and compares several machine learning classification models to enhance the accuracy and reliability of CVD prediction. We address the limitations of traditional algorithms by implementing and evaluating Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. Through rigorous evaluation, the Random Forest model consistently demonstrated superior accuracy and minimized misclassification rates.


Beyond core prediction, our proposed system incorporates advanced functionalities, including:

Real-time Prediction: Enables on-the-spot risk assessment.

Chatbot for Patient Assistance: Provides interactive support and information.

Health Trend Analysis: Offers insights into long-term health patterns.

This comprehensive AI-powered solution aims to contribute to early diagnosis, personalized healthcare, and improved decision support for CVD management.

Model Performance
The Random Forest model, trained using the Heart Disease Dataset, achieved an accuracy of approximately 90% when validated across multiple performance metrics.

Future Enhancements
Future improvements will focus on integrating deep learning architectures and leveraging larger datasets from medical institutions to further enhance prediction reliability and clinical applicability.

Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn (for ML models)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

(You can add specific libraries for chatbot, real-time prediction, or health trend analysis here if you've already implemented them, e.g., NLTK, Flask, etc.)
